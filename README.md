# Sales Data Analysis with Python

This project was developed as part of my learning journey in data analysis and aims to simulate a business challenges using a sales dataset. The focus was on transforming raw data into actionable insights while applying industry-standard tools and techniques.

Key Contributions:
- Designed and merged relational tables (customers, products, and orders) into a clean, analysis-ready dataset.
- Applied date parsing and data cleaning to ensure consistency across time-based analyses.
- Engineered profit metrics using custom logic that integrates sales values, discounts, and costs.
- Identified sales trends over time and segmented performance by product pricing.
- Built and interpreted a linear regression model to forecast future sales behavior.
- Investigated how delivery time impacts profitability through correlation analysis.
- Created visualizations to support data storytelling, including heatmaps and trend lines.

Throughout the process, I prioritized code readability, modular structure, and clarity in insights.
